            Hello again, same as cartoons anime and manga except this will be a list a lot sooner<br>
            since I don't play that many video games. Still have favourites though.

                    <th>Such an engaging platformer that's really well designed. It doesn't feel<br>
                        as fustrating as other games despite it's difficulty because it has the<br>
                        quick respawning after death. Madelines controls extremely well, there<br>
                        is no slipperly ness and that control makes it so precise to play. The<br>
                        story is surpisingly deep and is quite emotionally resenonant, and the<br>
                        music is goated.

                    <th>A game I grew up through many versions, just such a great sandbox game.<br>
                        It's progession is amazing and seeing your power increase throughout the<br>
                        entire game is so rewarding to watch. It's surpringsly tough too on the<br>
                        master mode difficulty even for someone whose played this game so much<br>
                        (wouldn't reccomend it for a starter playthrough but it's the way to play)<br>
                        The bosses are fun, the weapons are great and fun to use, though kinda<br>
                        wish there was some leveling system so I could use obselete weapons into<br>
                        the endgame, but that would break the progression so might not be for<br>
                        the best. It's a charming, extremely fun game that you should play at<br>
                        least once, it's cheap af as well.

                        Another classic valve game, just an amazing puzzle platformer that expands<br>
                        so greatly from the first. I kinda forget how short the original is, it feels<br>
                        like a proof of concept with it's length, it's still an enjoyable time but<br>
                        portal 2 is what is needed. The puzzles are so clever and I love how they<br>
                        evolve over the course of the game and how dynamic it all is, valve did so<br>
                        much with so little here. The story is so engaging and uncovering the lore<br>
                        behind aperture science through the old labs is amazing, and the characters<br>
                        are so interesting. The game as a whole is so funny, the comedy works so well<br>
                        for me too. Plus it's got cave johnson, you can't go wrong.
