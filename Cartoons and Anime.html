                        is very high quality in it's short 12 episode runtime. It's take <br>
                        on how society will integrate into our society is exteremly interesting<br>
                        especially about how our online personas and who we are irl interconnect.<br>
                        it's presentation is extremely well done, blends science fiction with horror<br>
                        in a futuristic way that makes the viewing experince incredible. Wo-<br>
                        uld highly reccomend watching this, it's short and so good.

                        me. It's so fast paced that it's hard to keep up with the dynamic and<br>
                        rapidly changing story, however still has a lot of substance to it.<br>
                        It's character's are so interesting and fun to watch, and the coming<br>
                        of age story that it achieves has such a lot of substance for how sho-<br>
                        rt it is. It's strange, quirky and wildy entertaining, and is something<br>
                        that deserves to be watched and hasn't been replicated in terms of it's<br>
                        charm and quality, it's sequal series' just don't compare.

                    <th>One of the most legendary series, It is as good as everyone says it is.<br>
                        Its characters is it's biggest strength, Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are so<br>
                        interesting and engaging, and they do carry the series. Making them the<br>
                        focal point and making the episodes episodic was the best choice for the<br>
                        show, allowing the characters to breathe and to be in a variety of scenarios.<br>
                        even the short story arc is engaging, basically the only times we hear<br>
                        about vicious and spikes past. The themes are so interesting and well<br>
                        executed, about the past and dealing with it, and it just is so emotionally<br>
                        engaging and powerful (Ed leaving is so sad) with an equalling powerful<br>
                        and engaging ending. A must watch (but if you watch anime you've probably<br>
                        already seen this)

                        Such a surpisingly clever series that has a lot of meaning to it's strange<br>
                        content. Denji is such a great protagonist and his struggles with intamcy<br>
                        and relationships are so interesting and sad to see. It's so chaotic in<br>
                        part 1 that it's hard to keep up with makima's plans to ruin denji, but<br>
                        those are subtley shown and it's so effective when you get to the end<br>
                        of part 1. I actually prefer part 2 though. Asa is my favourite character<br>
                        in the series, such a funny, interesting character (who is also literally<br>
                        me) and the slow burn of part 2 is keeping me engaged, while also diving<br>
                        more into the themes represented by Denji which were the parts that<br>
                        I engaged with the most. Can't wait to see how Part 2 ends (which might<br>
                        be the end of the series from the looks of it, fujimoto has never been<br>
                        the type to keep stories going for long)

                        has tons of quality elements to it. It's very funny, and the worldbuilding<br>
                        and characters are very engaing to me. It's biggest comparison is Harry<br>
                        Potter (which it directly references in an episode) but to me, everything<br>
                        about the owl house is just more appealing, the characters are interesting<br>
                        the relationships feel earned and not feel like tumblr fanships, the world<br>
                        and writing makes so much more sense and the handling of the plot is also<br>
                        a lot better. It's not perfect, but is so entertaining and would 100%<br>
                        reccomend to watch. It's such a shame that disney messed up the original<br>
                        plans for the series, but the 3 parts is still good tv regardless.<br>
