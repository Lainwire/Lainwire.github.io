                    <th>Such a classic neo soul record, and one of the best. One of those albums that is<br>
                        is just perfect, D'Angleo's vocals are incredibly powerful and passionate, and <br>
                        those instruemnts, so punchy and have so much weight to them, extremely groovy<br>
                        and catchy too. Neo Soul is really interesting in how it incorporates a lot of<br>
                        different genres like jazz and hiphop (and it's shown in the influences on this<br>
                        album, like and Prince and JDilla) and this feels like the most well executed<br>
                        version of neo soul out there, A must listen, especially Untitled (how does it<br>
                        feel), a classic insanely good long burn that's stunning to listen to.<br><br>

                    <th>This album is just incredible. I always been impressed by sampling, taking <br>
                        something that someone has already made and repurposing into something different<br>
                        and interesting and this is just like the endgame of sampling. Combing hundreds of<br>
                        samples and create suching a unique and amazing experience to listen to, the flow<br>
                        between each track is so well done and the whole album is such a variety of emotions<br>
                        while still making you dance for pretty much all of it. Another incredible experience<br> 
                        that is a must listen as well. If you have listened to this record or trying to listen<br>
                        to it I would reccomend tracking down the Zomba records version, it's the definitive<br>
                        version having an extra song that links up stay another season and Radio so much<br>
                        better.<br><br>

                        FAV SONGS: Since I left you, Radio, A Different Feeling, Electricity

                    <th>
                        This is one of most essential alt rocks albums and one the best debuts of any artist.<br>
                        Jeff buckley's voice is the stand out here, it's so powerful and beautiful it aids<br>
                        the listening experience so much. The insturements are so great as well, that blend of<br>
                        alt rock with folk influences that is so appealing to my ears. The Lyrics are a standout<br>
                        as well, so beautifully done and emotionally resenonant. Just a transcendent experince.<br>
                        It's a shame that this is the only album that jeff buckley could work on fully but I'm<br>
                        happy that grace managed to exist and as a standalone experience it's one that very few<br>
                        albums can surpass.<br><br>

                        FAV SONGS: All of them are standouts basically, Can't decide on favs for this album.

                    <th>The final album of the setagaya trilogy, it's probably one of the most consistent albums<br>
                        I've ever listened too, certianly in the fishmans catalog. There are higher highs on the<br>
                        98.12.28 (which is to be expected considering the live version of long season) but the<br>
                        album is so consistent that I rate it higher. It fully commits to the dream pop style<br>
                        that would summent the legacy of the band, which is not unexpected. The music is so pretty,<br>
                        atmospheric and etheral, aided by the ambient and neo-psychedilia influcences and Shinji<br>
                        Satos vocals which can be describe the same as the music, on top of it being impressive<br>
                        with his unique, high pitch falsetto voice. The songs are so varied, from the catchy high<br>
                        energy magic love, to the ehteral slow burn of daydream and everything in between it's all<br>
                        there. Just an incredible underated experience that like I said for all these albums you<br>
                        need to listen to it.<br><br>

                        FAV SONGS - again all of them, all the songs are consistently good

                    <th>Another alt rock masterpiece (though it is more of what you would consider piano rock)<br>
                        this is just another powerful experience that is so well executed as well. The Lyrics<br>
                        are very poetic, which I think descirbes the entire experience. Each track feels like<br>
                        it's own poem and the music represents that poetic feeling as well (which is helped<br>
                        by the excellent production) and her beautiful vocals. This is just a well done, ambitious<br>
                        record that has aged like fine wine<br><br>

                        FAV SONGS: On the Bound, Love Ridden, Paper Bag, Get Gone (basically all of the songs lol)
