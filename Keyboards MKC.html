            Mekanisk Fjell<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gH6ZuNw.jpg" alt="Mekanisk Fjell" width="600" height="500" class="center"><br>
            This was the first custom keyboard that I ever got and it's still with me. It's gotten<br>
            a bit scuffed over the years I had this thing, so I do want to get this thing cerakoted<br>
            either blue or black, since now I prefer those colours for boards and white much less<br>
            the board is a standard gh60 but far more boujee. If you have a fjell I would highly <br>
            reccomend taking off the middle points (which can be removed) it really improves the <br>
            typing feel of it.<br><br>
            
            I've built it with two builds. One was plateless with nk creams, which had 62g tx mediums<br>
            and the switches were lubed with ptfe powder, and the otherhad mx blacks (unlubed with 55g<br>
            tx mediums and filmed as well) on an alu plate. Both of these builds have their own benefits<br>
            and downsides and there is merit to both of them. If you want a more bouncy board I would<br>
            reccomend the plateless, and a more hard feel I would reccomend the alu plate. I do prefer<br>
            the mx blacks over the creams because they aren't long pole and I prefer the weighting of the<br>
            55g spring, so maybe the bestbuild could be the mx blacks plateless.<br><br>
            
            I still don't mind the creams as well, they are nice when modded. I think the only issue<br>
            with mx blacks plateless is the sound, the long poles do make the sound fuller, but the mx<br>
            blacks feel nice so I guess it's a trade off. So maybe a pom/pc plate with mx blacks could<br>
            be best overall if you like a softer mounting style. I will experiement more with this, I<br>
            am going to milmax one of my pcbs because I do want to use it as my experient boards and try<br>
            stuff out and break in switches as well. I mainly use gmk honor with cympk from gmk beige<br>
            addons but it works pretty well with gmk yuri r2 as well (just need to get the xtra kit).<br><br>

            HHKB professional hybrid<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7eCOv5.jpg" alt="hhkb professional hybrid" width="600" height="500" class="center"><br>
            This board is pretty standard honestly, but has topre switches, now topre switches are really<br>
            nice personally. They are quite tactile but have a softness and roundness that makes them<br>
            feel pretty great.<br><br>
            
            The layout is especially great, the hhkb layout is one of the best layoutsand if you never tried it<br>
            you really should. The control where caps lock is and backspace where |\ is are just perfect and <br>
            quite like the layers, even if you might not. The arrows are probably the only thing that that took<br>
            a while to get used to, since they are on the {[, :;, "' and /? keys but once you do it's quite intuative.<br>
            I got this board later than my fjell, but this layout is the reason why I tried it on my fjell and loved<br>
            it.<br><br>
            
            It's not for everyone but at least control and the on this is something you should experiment on a board<br>
            It's a good position for it, and just feels right. If you are gonna pick up a hhkb, would reccomend going<br>
            on japanese marketplaces like mercari, you get some great deals on those sites, bought mine for about half<br>
            of retail (exculding shipping). While it's not for everyone, I do think that topre boards are essential for<br>
            a hobbyist to at least try out to see if you like it, and then to have a topre board, and the hhkb is the best one for me.<br><br>
