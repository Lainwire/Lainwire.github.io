            Welcome to My Artisan Keycap Collection Page. Pretty self explanatory so Let's get into it.<br><br>

            Savannah Grey and Desert Brown Aerophant v1.5s by AEROKEYS<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIPuEDO.jpg" alt="Savannah Grey and Desert Brown Aerophant v1.5s by AEROKEYS" width="500" height="350" class="center"><br>
            <p>These were some of the first Artisan keycaps that I got, and the first raffle <br>
            that I won after a decent amount of ls. Super Awesome Caps. Also took <br>
            this pretty cool picture of them (even if the lighting wasn't great) but it's <br>
            probably the best image that will be in this since this was with a an actual  <br>
            camera and was in good lightning.<br><br></p>

            Pastel Mini Reaper V2 and Burgundy Astroboy by DCCAPS<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GTAOmb5.jpg" alt="Pastel Mini Reaper V2 and Burgundy Astroboy by DCCAPS" width="550" height="400" class="center"><br>
            <p>These two caps by dccaps are really cool. That mini reaper was probably the first <br>
            artisan keycap that I got, and the astroboy was from the first astroboy sale from <br>
            the return of dccaps in 2023. Astroboys were some of the first artisans I saw when <br>
            I got into the hobby (there are like 3 big sculpts, as of june 2024 I currently have<br>
            2 of them). I still want a few of the astroboy clws (Eva 01, Yuri and the beige one)<br>
            and mini reapers as well (black and orange as well) and a few of the other sculpts <br>
            that they offer like arriete and afroman, but for now I'm happy with these two.<br><br></p>

            Loot Bug Catnap by Sodie Caps<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/18b6SJt.jpg" alt="Loot Bug Catnap by Sodie Caps" width="400" height="550" class="center"><br>
            <p>This Sodie cap is based on the lootbug in lethal company, and I love how the cat sculpt<br>
            has been repurposed into the bug, it's pretty creativre. It also is just a great cap in<br>
            general. I do eventually want to go and find the rest of the lethal company clws in the<br>
            sale but I feel that would be really hard, but all of them would go for retail which would<br>
            be good. I do regret not picking up more because I beleive you could win multiple in that<br>
            but at least I got the one I liked the most in that sale.<br><br></p>

            Hack'd and Boopz Lightyear Cosmonaut V2 by Booper/Omniclectic<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7NxVzNE.jpg" alt="Hack'd and Boopz Lightyear Cosmonaut V2 by Booper/Omniclectic" width="650" height="500" class="center"><br>
            <p>Boop stuff is really cool in general but I think the cosmonaut is one of my favourites. <br>
            The boopz lightyear one was apart of the fufilment sale that I managed to get a apart of<br>
            and was the first one out of the two that I have. I managed to pick up the gh one for a<br>
            great price by a pretty cool person. I think gh colourways are my favourite and would<br>
            love to get a lot more of them (inclduing the rest of the set, even though I've been <br>
            that the colonel is unobtainium rip) and many other geekhack themed caps.<br><br></p>

            Hearthfire Orochi by Keyforge<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/en5KDNF.jpg" alt="Hearthfire Orochi by Keyforge" width="650" height="500" class="center"><br>
            <p>I don't have too much to say about this one, since I generally don't have a big affintiy<br>
            to Keyforge, except that it's a neat cap and it was won in a charity event that was for <br>
            movember by nostyle and that was really cool to see happen. Love stuff like that in the <br>
            hobby.<br></p>

            Chessman V2 Eggface V2 by Nightcaps<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LmQ7Fox.jpg" alt="Chessman V2 Eggface V2 by Nightcaps" width="650" height="500" class="center"><br>
            <p>This sculpt is such simple but effective one, love the variety that comes from it. Some <br>
            of the clws that have been made are crazy (like the elden ring ones, they are insanely good)<br>
            Chessman is also a very simple and effective clw, and it works so well with a lot of keycaps<br>
            as well it's very cool. Pretty glad to have this cap (and the person who sold it to me is cool af)<br><br></p>

            Pumpkin Creep Devilled Egg By Nightcaps<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GuH0opz.jpg" alt="Pumpkin Creep Devilled Egg By Nightcaps" width="500" height="500" class="center"><br>
            <p>A Varient of the eggface that I like quite a bit, this was apart of a random sale where you<br>
            see the varients and you get a random one. I generally don't enter these types of sales but<br>
            with this one specifically I like all the varients and the clw to enter, and I happened to <br>
            win. In hindsight I'm pretty glad I got this one, the mouth resin writing is like tape over<br>
            the mouth which I think is pretty cool. The candy corn horns are a nice touch to the pretty<br>
            nice orange colour that is the base. <br></p>

            Carbon Neutral Prayge by Alpha Keycaps<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BGGAiXd.jpg" alt="Carbon Neutral Prayge by Alpha Keycaps" width="500" height="500" class="center"><br>
            <p>My first (and only) Alpha keycaps win. A very simple cap and clw but I quite like the orange <br>
            colour. It's based on the carbon keyset which has ran in both sa and gmk, and is such a great<br>
            set that I really want. The designer t0mb3ry said that an r3 would hopefully come soon which<br>
            is great as long as it has mx hhkb support giggle. This prayge would be perfect for it. Still<br>
            really want more sculpts by alpha (george tut is sick). Yohan is a great person as well.<br><br></p>

            Hack Orange Topre Singeshot Skull by Clack Factory<br>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtNPZY.jpg" alt="Hack Orange Topre Singeshot Skull by Clack Factory" width="650" height="500" class="center"><br>
            <p>I think this, the astroboy or the Catnap are probably my favourites in my small collection. <br>
            Skulls have such great history to them being the first artisan keycaps and I'm so grateful <br>
            that I have one in my collection. Hack orange is probably my favourite clw and I love it so <br>
            much. Still want to hunt for other clacks like candycorn and ogre (rip my wallet -_-) but I'm<br>
            pretty happy with this one. Pairs perfectly with my hhkb with it as an accent piece.</p>
